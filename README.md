# Botv1
BarRobot is a South African design for a Bartending Robot machine.  
It comes with a really easy to use user interface: Selector Switch to choose Single, Double.  And one big red illuminited "Go" button.  Can't be easier!
WS2812B LEDs surround the spirits bottle, helping to invite friends closer - attracted by RGB Blinkies!
